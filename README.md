# **Tennage Mutant Ninja Turtles**

**Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute**

This site is based around the classic cartoon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles along with a theme tune to keep the suspense going.  The target audience is really for all ages and is a simple memory game to match a pair of cards, once these have all been matched the game has been won.


In Short:

- Simple card matching game
- Wide target audience
- Increase timings with memory of cards

# **Demo**

# **UX**

This website has two navigatible pages.  The home page is just for simplicity with a 'Turtle Shell' background, consisting of an 'Enter' button to navigate to the next page in order to start the Game, an 'Instructions Modal' which pops up and gives you instructions on how the game works, then some social links that the user can follow and simply a copyright tag.  The second page is laid out with 'Buttons at the top of the page and then the cards laid out below.  This is a simple match the cards game with theme music involved.


## User Stories

- As a user I want it to test me each time I reset the game to see if i can improve or go quicker than before.
- As a user I particulary like the theme music and this takes me back to my childhood as I was a big fan of the Cartoon.
- As a user I wanted this to be a fun little game to play and get the family involved with it.
- As a user I wanted this game to be fun whilst travelling or if you simply have 5 minutes to kill wherever you are.
- I wanted the user to be able to browse this site on any device.


# **Features**

My website is two page navigatable pages.  The first page is simply a home page, consisting of a full background image with centered a centered button, modal, Social links and a copyright tag.

- ENTER - This is a simple button on the index.html page which is linked to the main.html page which then opens another page, which essentially is the game 'Area'.
- INSTRUCTIONS/MODAL - This is a modal on the home page index.html.  This Modal when clicked pops up and give you instructions on how the game is meant to be played.
- SOCIAL LINKS/FOOTER - There are three links which the user can follow to take them to social links, they are: Facebook, Twitter and Github.  Then my name as copyright.
- START GAME - This Button once clicked will start the theme music and essentially start the Game.
- MUTE MUSIC - This Button once clicked will Pause the theme music and if you click start game it will resume where it was paused.
- HOME - This button once clicked will take you back to the Home page.
- RESTART - This Button will restart the game at any time once clicked./


## Features left to implement

I think if I need to add more features to this site I would probably need to add some merchandise store to gain more interest from users. I would also like to see a big image gallery in future to entice more potential footfall

# **Strategy**

I set out to make this an enjoyable site to visit as well as an easy site to navigate. I wanted to keep it simple but still enough on the page to navigate through

# **Scope**

For every new or old music lover, I wanted to create an easy friendly navigatable site that has ease of access and shows the users what the band is all about

# **Structure**

This website has been laid out in a way as to get a feel for who the band are by visual and then you get to know about the band, then listen to their music.  

# **Skeleton**

I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes - Second time I have used Balsamiq and I found it to be a very good tool, will continue to use this

# **Surface**

The surface of this site is easy on the eye with eye catching images and an easy navigational panel. I opted for Pangolin font which is easy to read and very eye catching. All sections are aligned correctly apart from the Band images section. I struggled with this section as everytime I changed the 'Class' from row it would vertically align my images, this class I got from Bootstrap, I corrected this as much as I could by using padding

# **Technologies Used**

- Html - Html was used to create the layout of the website
- CSS - CSS was used to syle my website
- Balsamiq Wireframes - Balsamiq was used to create wireframes to get an idea of layout
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - I used bootstrap for responsivness and created an image carousel, I also used the CDN for this project and Bootstrap Grid
- W3Schools - I found W3Schools extremelly helpful with this project and I used this responsive form [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_form_responsive) i altered it a bit to suit my website
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) I used font awesome for the icons
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used Google fonts for my fonts and i used "Pangolin" throughout the entire page as i think it works well with the site
- [W3Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - I used this to test my HTML and CSS

# **Testing**

I used several different browsers to test my site, namely Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, Chrome was absolutely fine, however Firefox and Edge, my Social links at the bottom didnt work out, I Tried putting my code through Validator and found little errors but couldnt fix this issue, I also tired using different classes to wrap the icons to try and sort this issue but to no avail. The responsiveness works well across these browsers, I also tested this on Google Pixel 3, Samsung Tablet SMTM85 and the page responded well. I also used Dev tools to inspect on the different devices that are available and on an ipad pro the images go vertically but are still aligned nicely.
All the links and different sections work nicely and collapse on different devices.
Tested CSS in W3Validator and only found minimal errors, I also tested my HTML in W3Validator  and the only errors were my Video section which i struggled to changed as i copied this directly from [you tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zz7LipDBFg)

# **Deployment**

This site is deployed directly from GitHub, everytime this is updated it will automatically update the site. This site is deployed directly from GitHub itself.  This directory can be cloned to open on another IDE.
